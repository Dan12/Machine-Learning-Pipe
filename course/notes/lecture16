Joint model of images and captions
    -train a model on the images
    -train a model of the word count from the captions
    -added a new top layer that is connected to the top layer of individual models
    -the further trained the whole system
    -used a deep Boltzmann Machine
    -pretrain a Deep Boltzmann Machine
        -bottom up weights are 2 times as big as their top-down counterparts, scaled symmetric weights
Hierarchical coordinate frames
    -CNNs, loose precise spatial relationships, necessary for very high level features
    -people are good at extracting, after seeing a shape once we can recoginize it at other viewpoints
    -use hierarchical coordinate frame
        -use a group of neurons to represent the conjunction of the shape of a feature and its pose relative to the retina
        -pose is relative, relationship between the coordinate frame of the object and the coordinate frame of the retina
        -use relationship between parts to recoginize larger objects
        -inverse computer graphics (use the pose of the mouth and pose of a nose to get the pose of a face if they agree)
        -spatial transformations modeled by linear operations
        -learn hierarchicy of visual entities
        -invariant geometric properties are in the weights, as the pose changes the activites should changes
    -our visual systems impose coordinate frame in order to represent shapes
Bayesian optomization of hyper-parameters (link: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf)
    -sample random combinations, some parameters will have much effect and some wont
    -look at current results and try and predict good combinations
    -predict how well and the uncertainty of a new prediction
    -Gaussian Process models: assume simialr inputs give similar outputs
        -very weak but sensible prior of effects of hyper-parameters
        -lean the appropriate scale for measuring similarity
        -set a scale for the dimension to measure the similarity of that dimension
        -predict a gaussian distribution of values
        -low variance for predictions close to what we have seen and vice versa for predictions we haven't seen
    -Method
        -keep track of best setting
        -each experiment might stay the same or it might improve
        -pick parameters such that the expected improvement is big
    -better than person at finding hyper-parameters given many resources
    -keeps track of all trends that a person might miss
Fog of progress
    -Development of technology is exponential
    -can't see too far into the future or make long term predictions
